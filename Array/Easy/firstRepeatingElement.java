        Given an array arr[] of size n, find the first repeating element. The element should occur more than once and the index of its first occurrence should be the smallest.

        Note:- The position you return should be according to 1-based indexing. 

        Example 1:
        Input:
        n = 7
        arr[] = {1, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6}
        Output: 2
        Explanation: 
        5 is appearing twice and 
        its first appearence is at index 2 
        which is less than 3 whose first 
        occuring index is 3.

        Example 2:
        Input:
        n = 4
        arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}
        Output: -1
        Explanation: 
        All elements appear only once so 
        answer is -1.
