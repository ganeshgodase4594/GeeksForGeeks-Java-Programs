        Given an integer x, find the square root of x. If x is not a perfect square, then return floor(âˆšx).

        

        Example 1:
        Input:
        x = 5
        Output: 2
        Explanation: Since, 5 is not a perfect 
        square, floor of square_root of 5 is 2.

        Example 2:
        Input:
        x = 4
        Output: 2
        Explanation: Since, 4 is a perfect 
        square, so its square root is 2.
